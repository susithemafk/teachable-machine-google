Teachable machine by Google and my implementation

Hi, this is my project where I tried to implement a Teachable machine by Google. 
To make it work you can start it locally on live server or just take all files in the repository and upload them to the server. 
Hope you'll have fun. 

Also you can try it on https://simpsons.hustla.cz/
